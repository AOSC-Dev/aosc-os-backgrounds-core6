Community Wallpapers
====================

The repository contains wallpaper submissions for AOSC OS from our community, these wallpapers are pre-installed on every AOSC OS copy.

We are always open for new submissions. If you have wallpapers (created by yourself) that are worth submitting, please do so by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/community-wallpapers/compare). With your pull request, you should do the following:

- Put all your wallpapers in your own directory, named after yourself (for instance, `/Your_Name`). Image files should be named as the title of the wallpaper, with spaces replaced with underscores ("\_").
- In `/Your_Name/files.yaml`, list all the wallpaper titles so our build system could find your wallpapers.
- In `/files.yaml`, fill in your name, e-mail address, wallpaper license, and the directory (`Your_Name`) in which contains your wallpapers.
